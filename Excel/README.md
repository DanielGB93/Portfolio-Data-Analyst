# Potfolio-Data-Analyst
I am Daniel Garc√≠a, a Data Analyst from Honduras who is passionate about innovation, data, and life!

In this portfalio yo can find some of my recent projects which I had develop in Python, SQL, R, Excel and Power BI in the last 4 years. 
Some of them have been part of courses and others have been adapted to be able to upload them in github. 
 
If you want to know more about how data can be utilized in your bussines, no matter the size of your company, please let me know through email.
I'll be very glad to share more about how data moves the world with you!
